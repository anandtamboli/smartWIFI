# smartWIFI 

SmartWiFi is a Wi-Fi module development kit that can help you to prototype your Wi-Fi based products within a few lines of Lua script.

Based on ESP8266 chip and module built over it, the board is jam-packed with many exciting features & functions in this tiny little development module at a very affordable price

### FEATURES
- Arduino-like hardware IO: Open source firmware NodeMCU i.e. an advanced API for hardware IO, reduces the redundant work for configuring and manipulating hardware. The board allows you to code like Arduino in interactive manner with Lua scripting language.
- NodeJS style network API: The firmware provides event-driven API for network applications, which facilitates developers writing code running this tiny little board in NodeJS style. Greatly speed up your Wi-Fi / IOT application developing process.
- Reprogramming possibility: IO button available on the kit also functions as a re-flashing button. 
- Multiple uses: The module has ESP, serial to USB converter as well as 3.7V LiPo battery charger.
